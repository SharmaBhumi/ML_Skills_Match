# ML_Skills_Match

Main.py has the logic to read the CSV file and report the key words. And finally there is a model predict at the bottom.

You may have to install NLTK and some other tools to make the python script work. Please try and let me know.

Here are the issues:

1. Currently the program returns lot of words that are not actually ML tools/technologies. We will have to update the STOPWORDS or come up with our own script to filter the words that are not required.
2. This is more specific to ML skillset, we may have to develop similar ones for Data Analyst, Data Scientist etc.,
3. We talked about Naive Bayes Classfier, take a look at the link below to see if we can make use of it:

4. Lot of sentiment analysis projects uses textblob, we can tweak it little bit to make it work for some of our requirements. Please check the documentation in the link below:
